# Design guideline - Group 8

## Theme:
The design of the app is going to be a serious, dark, and neutral application. It will follow modern trends by implementing a dark theme by default. In case of a light mode implementation, a different theme and color scheme will be used.

Keywords: dark, serious, neutral.



## Color scheme:

We use mainly shades of gray to differentiate all widgets and white for text and selection color. The blue color will be used for buttons or important information, such as notifications. 
2D2D30 will be the main color. This color is used on post and board notices.



## Hierarchy and layouts:
The most important message is to post and interact with boards/users
  - Order of importance:
  - Post on the feed
  - Comments on posts
  - Boards
  - Groups
  - Profile page

The app has many sections, which includes:
  - Feed
  - New post
  - Board
  - Group
  - Discovery
  - Messages
  - Login
  - Register
  - Profile Page
  - Notifications
  
The elements will be placed under each other starting with the Top nav and the notification icon, then the feed section stretching all the way down to the bottom nav which has the navigation buttons such as add post, home, messages, discover and groups.




## Image
The app will not contain many images, as users should be able to post pictures along with text with their posts. A logo will be present at the top of the app, visible from all main pages.

Users should be able to set a profile picture to their account. If no picture is set, a default picture will be used. Each user post will contain this profile picture in a small format, indicating who the poster is.



## Icons
At the bottom of the screen, a menu bar will be stuck, containing navigation buttons to the primary pages mentioned in Hierarchy and layouts section of this document. These will have universal icons, making it easy for users to navigate.

The following icon pack will be used: https://iconduck.com/sets/eva-icons

User posts will contain icons for upvotes and downvotes, as well as comments.

All icons will have the color #B8B8BB. When icon buttons are clicked, they will change color. For main navigation, this color will be white #FFFFFF. Upvote and downvote buttons will have blue color #007ACC, where the downvote button will have some opacity to separate them.



## Typography
As the app will remain true to modern standards, a Sans-Serif font will be used. Therefore, the default font used will be Inter.

Bold font will be used for headers, post titles and other texts to be highlighted.

Text scaling:

## Border Rounding
To achieve a modern look the group has so far used value 15 in edges. This value might change for more or less depending on our view on the app, but it will try to reflect a modern look.





## Shadows
The group will use subtle shadows to make widgets pop-out and look on top of the app. the values have been Y= 4 and B=4 so far this might increase or decrease depending on size and importance of the element
