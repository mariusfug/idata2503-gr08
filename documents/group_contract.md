 ## Roles and task distribution
Everyone in the group will get a specific responsibility in the project. Everyone will join in the whole project, but each member has the responsibility to make sure their assigned task is done. 

## Roles
  - Team leader, communicator - calls in for meetings, brings the team together, represents the group

  - Quality control – checks code, contributes with testing, reads through documents, checks for errors 
  
## Procedures
  - Weekly meeting
    Thursdays from 10.00-12.00, we have meeting about the project; what we have done since last meeting, this week goal(s), issues, etc.
    Location: At campus. In unique case (Illness or similar cases which keep the campus closed) we have the meeting on Discord.
    The weekly meeting will be documented.

  - Communication platform
    The communication platform for this group is Discord. 

  - Presence
    Anyone in the group can suggest for a meetup. Everyone must agree on date, hour, and location (campus or Discord) for present.
    One can only suggest for a meetup at the latest the day before but appreciate if they manage earlier.

  - Checkpoints
    The group find dates and suggest to the teacher. The day before checkpoint, whole group meet up and discuss what topic(s) to bring up at the checkpoint. 

  - Absence notification
    If a group member will be late or cannot attend, they need to notify the whole group on the communication platform soon as possible. If the absent is planned, give a notice at the latest 24h before. 

  - Preparation
    Before weekly meeting, prepare for the topics; what you have done past week, suggested goals for this week, any issues and if you have a planned absent for the upcoming week.
    Before meetup, prepare your current task. If physically present, check if you have the right file(s) on the laptop or in the Git.

  - Documentation
    The documentation will be saved in Discord threads. 
    The finished documents will be saved as PDF. The documents in their original filetype will be saved in a folder inside the shared folder. 

  - Code Version Control
    In this project we use GitHub. To avoid conflict, there will be few rules:
      1. Always inform the group which file(s) you are working on.
      2. In the case of a merge conflict, resolve the issue(s) with the rest of group.

  - Hand-ins
    The team leader has the responsibility with the hand-ins. 
    If no one has big urge to deliver the hand-ins, the team leader must do it.

## Expectations of the group members
  -	Everyone will respect each other. 
  -	Ask each other for help if stuck on the project.
  -	Notify everyone in the group when you’re done with a task and which task you’re starting on after.
  -	Be open about issues or problems that will affect the project.
